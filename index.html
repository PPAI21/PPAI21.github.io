								<h2>Scope and Topics</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							The availability of massive amounts of data, coupled with high-performance cloud computing 
							platforms, has driven significant progress in artificial intelligence and, in particular, 
							machine learning and optimization. It has profoundly impacted several areas, including computer 
							vision, natural language processing, and transportation. However, the use of rich data sets 
							also raises significant privacy concerns: They often reveal personal sensitive information 
							that can be exploited, without the knowledge and/or consent of the involved individuals, for 
							various purposes including monitoring, discrimination, and illegal activities. 
							<br>
							The second AAAI Workshop on Privacy-Preserving Artificial Intelligence (PPAI-21) held at the 
							<a href="https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-21/">Thirty-Fifth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-21)</a> 
							builds on the success of last year’s <a href="https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~fferdinando3/cfp/PPAI20/">AAAI PPAI</a> 
							to provide a platform for researchers, AI practitioners, and policymakers to discuss technical 
							and societal issues and present solutions related to privacy in AI applications. 
							The workshop will focus on both the theoretical and practical challenges related to the design 
							of privacy-preserving AI systems and algorithms and will have strong multidisciplinary 
							components, including soliciting contributions about policy, legal issues, and societal 
							impact of privacy in AI. 
							</p>
							PPAI-21 will place particular emphasis on: 
							<ol>
								<li>Algorithmic approaches to protect data privacy in the context of learning, 
									optimization, and decision making that raise fundamental challenges for 
								existing technologies.</li> 
								<li>Privacy challenges created by the governments and tech industry response to 
								the Covid-19 outbreak.</li> 
								<li>Social issues related to tracking, tracing, and surveillance programs.</li> 
								<li>Algorithms and frameworks to release privacy-preserving benchmarks and data sets.</li> 
							</ol>

							<h3>Topics</h3>
							The workshop organizers invite paper submissions on the following (and related) topics:
							<ul>
								<li>Applications of privacy-preserving AI systems</li>
								<li>Attacks on data privacy</li>
								<li>Differential privacy: theory and applications</li>
								<li>Distributed privacy-preserving algorithms</li>
								<li>Human rights and privacy</li>
								<li>Privacy issues related to the Covid-19 outbreak </li>
								<li>Privacy policies and legal issues </li>
								<li>Privacy preserving optimization and machine learning </li>
								<li>Privacy preserving test cases and benchmarks</li>
								<li>Surveillance and societal issues </li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Finally, the workshop will welcome papers that describe the release of privacy-preserving benchmarks and data sets that can be used by the community to solve fundamental problems of interest, including in machine learning and optimization for health systems and urban networks, to mention but a few examples. 
							</p>

							<h3>Format</h3>
							<p>
							The workshop will be a one-day and a half meeting. 
							The first session (half day) will be dedicated to privacy challenges, particularly those 
							risen by the Covid-19 pandemic tracing and tracking policy programs. 
							The second, day-long, session will be dedicated to the workshop technical content about 
							privacy-preserving AI. The workshop will include a number of (possibly parallel) technical 
							sessions, a virtual poster session where presenters can discuss their work, with the aim of 
							further fostering collaborations, multiple invited speakers covering crucial challenges for 
							the field of privacy-preserving AI applications, including policy and societal impacts, a 
							number of tutorial talks, and will conclude with a panel discussion. 
							</p>

							<h3>Attendance</h3>
							Attendance is open to all. At least one author of each accepted submission must be present at the workshop.
